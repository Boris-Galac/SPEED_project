                <p>
                  The <span>“SPEED”</span> methodology combines new approaches
                  of social innovation, social inclusion with development of key
                  competences of pupils in four European countries in social
                  enterprise as well as involving the local community with SPEED
                  school enterprises.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  School education will target the reinforcing and development
                  of key competences in lifelong learning for example by
                  promoting cross-curricular collaboration, cooperating with
                  stakeholders in local communities as well as promoting the
                  development of new fair based partnerships between schools,
                  businesses and wider society.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The core goals of SPEED are to identify, empower and
                  train/educate new human resources, which are indispensable in
                  the context of social enterprise starting with pupils and
                  their teachers.
                  <br /><br />
                  Based on 3 already existing innovations the objectives of the
                  project are therefore to combine them to create a new school
                  business form, the SPEED model.
                  <br /><br />
                  The SPEED innovation is about changing the role of young
                  people in school to become economic leaders for their
                  community in a new way of organising business that prioritises
                  fairness and care for the environment.
                  <br /><br />
                  Once they have achieved their Speed enterprises in the school
                  the young people will engage their own community creating an
                  innovative relationship whereby the school helps the community
                  make its own economy stronger, more ethical and eco friendly.
                  <br /><br />
                  The key to this innovation is the way wealth is being created
                  and shared and the ownership of actual shares among young
                  people and community members in sustainable enterprises.
                  <br /><br />
                  It is also an innovation that straddles all three sectors,
                  Public, private and NGO.
                  <br /><br />
                  Core results are the development of key competences of pupils
                  for lifelong learning, by promoting cross-curricular
                  collaboration among school learning and non formal learning in
                  the local community. This includes creative and innovative
                  learning approaches and environments in school enterprises and
                  by cooperating with stakeholders in the local community but
                  also abroad with the SPEED community. <br /><br />SPEED will
                  manifest an interdisciplinary teaching in social, cultural,
                  environmental, economic, design and other contexts.
